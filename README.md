# Ternary LLM

Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Ternary LLMs mitigate these demands through weight quantization via 2-bit ternary values {-1, 0, +1}, achieving significant compression often with 50 − 90% sparsity. However, existing approaches face limitations: 
- Existing CPU and GPU do not support native 2-bit operations, and existing libraries like PyTorch and CUDA do not have dedicated computing kernels for ternary weights.
- Existing sparse formats like Compressed Sparse Column are not optimized for ternary values, causing extra storage and decompression overhead.
- Methods optimized for ternary weights, such as BitNet, RSR, and RSR++, fail to capture sparsity structures.

Therefore, we aim to solve these challenges by novel algorithms, code optimization, and hardware accelerators. This repository contains code for three projects:
- **SSR: Sparse Segment Reduction for Ternary GEMM Acceleration** (target limitation 3)
- **Fast Ternary Large Language Model Inference with Addition-Based Sparse GEMM on Edge Devices** (target limitations 1 and 2)
- **An Accelerator for Ternary Language Models based on FPGA** (target limitation 1)
